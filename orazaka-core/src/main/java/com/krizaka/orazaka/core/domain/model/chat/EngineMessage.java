 * One message of a conversation as the engine sees it, in pure Java: who speaks and what is said.
 * Interceptors and ports read and write this type, never a model library's (ADR-092 §4 rule 1).
 *
 * <p>A message that came from a library keeps it in {@code nativeMessage} (media, tool answers:
 * what a role and a text cannot say) so that leaving the engine loses nothing; only the adapter at
 * the edge reads it back. Code outside that edge treats it as opaque.
 *
 * @param role who speaks
 * @param text what is said (empty rather than {@code null})
 * @param nativeMessage the library message this one stands for, or {@code null}
