/**
 * Gates the synchronous chat path on what the actor may do and can afford (ADR-033 §6.2).
 *
 * <p>Two questions in order, because they have different answers: <b>entitlement</b> gates access
 * ("your plan does not include video") and <b>credits</b> gate volume ("your plan includes video,
 * you have none left"). Asking them separately is what lets the paywall say which one it is.
 *
 * <p>Streaming chat must not pay a broker round-trip (AGENTS.md §6), so both checks are synchronous
 * — and the hold is the only blocking billing call on the turn. Settlement happens later, off the
 * response path, against the tokens the model actually produced.
 *
 * <p>A refusal is raised as a {@link PipelineShortCircuitException}: the pipeline executor swallows
 * ordinary interceptor failures so a broken enrichment cannot lose a user's turn, and a gate that
 * were merely logged would let every refused request through.
 *
 * <p><b>Failure posture: open, and accounted</b> (ADR-064). When billing cannot be reached the turn
 * is served without a hold — a billing outage must not become a chat outage, the same trade the
 * asynchronous submission path made and wrote down in {@code JobMeteringService}. It was already
 * served free before this was written, by the executor's {@code catch}; the difference is that now
 * somebody chose it, and it leaves a record: {@link UnmeteredTurnRepository} makes the turn durable
 * before it is served, so free inference during an outage can be reconciled afterwards. If that
 * record cannot be made either, the turn is refused — reconcilable free inference is the product,
 * silent free inference is not. Everything else this gate did not anticipate stops the turn: it
 * {@linkplain #failsClosed() fails closed}.
 *
 * <p>The opposite posture to the crisis guard's facing an image it cannot read (ADR-063), and both
 * are chosen: what that guard's failure costs is a person, what this gate's costs is margin.
