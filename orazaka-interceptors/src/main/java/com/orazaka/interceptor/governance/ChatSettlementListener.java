/**
 * Closes the hold {@link EntitlementInterceptor} took, against the tokens the model actually
 * produced (ADR-033 §6.2).
 *
 * <p>The two halves of the synchronous protocol live side by side on purpose: the interceptor opens
 * the reservation before inference, this listener closes it after, and keeping them in one package
 * is what stops the settle half being forgotten when the gate is changed.
 *
 * <p>Off the response path by construction. Spring publishes {@code ChatCompletedEvent} after the
 * engine has already returned the answer, so a slow or failing ledger cannot delay the last token a
 * user sees — the rule the design states twice, and the reason settle is not part of the hold's
 * round trip.
 *
 * <p>Reports <b>measurements</b>, never a unit: whether chat bills in kilotokens is a property of
 * the pricebook row the hold was pinned to, and naming a unit here would break the day a model is
 * repriced. A turn whose provider reported no usage is released rather than billed at its estimate
 * — charging a guess would hide the reporting gap behind revenue.
