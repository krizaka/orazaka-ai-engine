/**
 * Immutable context for Orazaka AI requests. Carries multi-session and multi-modal preferences.
 *
 * <p>This context is inherently thread-safe and safe for concurrent access via Virtual Threads due
 * to its immutable nature and defensive copying.
 *
 * <p><b>Two namespaces, and nothing else, in {@code preferences}</b> (ADR-064). What the platform
 * declares about a turn — a Studio's scope guard, the metering marker, the session — lives under
 * {@value #PLATFORM_NAMESPACE}. What the user wrote about themselves lives under {@value
 * #USER_PREFERENCE_NAMESPACE}, put there by {@link #userPreferences}. The pipeline merges only
 * these two into the metadata its interceptors read, beside keys of its own that carry neither
 * prefix — so a preference cannot name the actor, the conversation or the roles, however it is
 * spelled and wherever the engine writes them. A preference used to be able to: {@code userId} and
 * {@code orazaka.metering.deferred} saved through the profile endpoint moved or removed the credit
 * hold.
 *
 * @param userId The unique identifier of the user making the request.
 * @param conversationId The session identifier for conversation thread state mapping.
 * @param preferences Platform declarations and namespaced user preferences, see above.
 * @param authorities The resolved security roles tied to the user session.
 * @see Authority
