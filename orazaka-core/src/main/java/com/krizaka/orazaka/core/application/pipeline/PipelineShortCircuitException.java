/**
 * Thrown by an interceptor that is <b>refusing</b> the request, not failing on it.
 *
 * <p>The distinction matters because {@link DynamicPipelineExecutor} deliberately swallows
 * interceptor failures: an enrichment step that breaks must degrade the answer, never lose the
 * user's turn. That is right for enrichment and wrong for a gate — an entitlement or credit refusal
 * that were merely logged would let the request proceed exactly as if it had been allowed, which is
 * the one outcome a gate exists to prevent.
 *
 * <p>This exception is therefore the pipeline's only escape hatch: the executor re-throws it and
 * swallows everything else. Interceptors that enrich must not use it.
 *
 * <p>The {@code reason} is a machine-readable code the transport layer maps to a status —
 * deliberately not a status code itself, because the core knows nothing about HTTP.
