/**
 * Payload for a {@link Capability#STUDIO} intention — one run of an installed Studio (ADR-034).
 *
 * <p>Carries the installation rather than the Studio key: the pinned blueprint version and the
 * actor's configuration both live on the installation, and resolving them here would duplicate a
 * decision the Studio context owns.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately a <b>contract-copy</b>: it uses only JDK types rather than depending on {@code
 * orazaka-studio-api}, exactly as {@code BillableCapability} contract-copies {@link Capability} in
 * the opposite direction. Whether {@code business} takes that dependency is a phase-3 decision,
 * made when the DAG interpreter actually lands here.
 *
 * @param installationId The installation to run (required).
 * @param inputs The actor's answers to the blueprint's input schema, validated server-side against
 *     that schema before any credit is held; never null.
