/**
 * Refuses a turn that strays into the domain its pack declared out of bounds (ADR-051).
 *
 * <p>One of the four controls {@code regulatory_class: SENSITIVE} switches on. The other three are
 * properties of stored data; this one is the only one that has to act while the user is waiting,
 * which is why it is an interceptor and not a scheduled job.
 *
 * <p><b>The pack declares the domain; this class never names one.</b> A legal-drafting pack refuses
 * legal advice, a medical-summary pack refuses diagnosis, and both are this code plus a manifest.
 * Naming either here would put a pack's subject matter in an engine library — AGENTS.md §12, and
 * the fourth time that rule has decided a design.
 *
 * <p><b>What this is, honestly.</b> Word-boundary term matching. It catches the question asked
 * plainly and misses the one asked obliquely, and no amount of term-list grooming changes that. It
 * is worth having because of what it replaces: a sentence in a prompt, which is not a control at
 * all (PACK_CATALOGUE §6.2) — a model can be talked out of an instruction and cannot be talked out
 * of a short-circuit. A pack whose boundary needs a classifier should not be SENSITIVE; it should
 * wait for the REGULATED work where a reviewed model has a budget.
 *
 * <p><b>Not AI-dependent</b>, deliberately: the guard must survive the {@code disable-ai}
 * kill-switch. A boundary that stops being enforced exactly when the platform is degraded is a
 * boundary that fails open at the worst moment.
