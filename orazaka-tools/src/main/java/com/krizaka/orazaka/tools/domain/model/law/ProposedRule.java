 * A rule as the derivation model proposes it, in the shape of a ruleset rule (ADR-089 §3): what a

 * until {@link RuleProposalVet} has read it.
 *
 * @param ruleId the rule id
 * @param title what the rule checks
 * @param severity {@code BLOCKING}, {@code MAJOR} or {@code ADVISORY}
 * @param method {@code DETERMINISTIC} or {@code JUDGMENT}
 * @param subject the pattern of what the rule is about; a PASS quotes a passage of it (#127)
 * @param check the deterministic check; absent for a {@code JUDGMENT} rule
 * @param question the question a {@code JUDGMENT} rule asks; absent otherwise
 * @param citation the article in words, as a finding shows it
 * @param sourceUrl the official address of the article
 * @param onPass what a PASS says
 * @param onFail what a FAIL says
 * @param fixtures the fixture pair
 * @param law the articles it rests on, at least one
