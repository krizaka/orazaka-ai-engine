 * What a promotion proposes to orazaka-packs (ADR-089 §5 step 4): one dated ruleset revision of a

 *
 * @param kindId the kind, which is also the ruleset id
 * @param jurisdiction the jurisdiction
 * @param effectiveFrom the law's in-force day, which is the ruleset's {@code version}
 * @param revision 1 for a new version, one more for our own correction of it
 * @param revisionNote what this revision changes
 * @param rules the rules, in the order of the request
 * @param articles the article versions the rules pin, each once
 * @param provenance the derivation, the proposals, the review and the imports
