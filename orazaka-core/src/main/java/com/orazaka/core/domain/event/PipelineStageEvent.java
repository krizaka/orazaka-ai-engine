 * Immutable Spring Application Event emitted as each interceptor in the prompt pipeline finishes

 * UI without coupling the core to any transport.
 *
 * <p>Published synchronously, in-process, on the request thread — never through the broker (chat is
 * the synchronous interactive path). Correlated downstream by {@code conversationId}.
 *
 * @param conversationId The conversation this stage belongs to (used to route the SSE event).
 * @param interceptorId The interceptor class simple name (matches the pipeline-ack schema ids).
