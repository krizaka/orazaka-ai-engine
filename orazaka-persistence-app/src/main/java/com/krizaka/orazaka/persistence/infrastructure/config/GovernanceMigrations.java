 * permissions) in the shared {@code orazaka_db}, next to the host service's own Flyway migration
 * (krizaka-internal#2255).
 *
 * <p>The database is shared by three contexts (conversation, job, governance), one Flyway history
 * table each; this context's is {@value #HISTORY_TABLE} and its files are {@value #LOCATION},
 * outside {@code db/migration} so the host's own scan never sees them (two {@code V1} would
 * collide). It runs as the host's {@link FlywayMigrationStrategy}, hence inside the database
 * initialisation that everything using the database waits for, with the host's migrator credentials
 * and settings.
 *
 * <p>Baselining at {@code 0}: on a fresh database where another context already created its tables,
 * {@code baseline-on-migrate} at the default version 1 would mark this context's {@code V1} applied
 * and skip it.
