/**
 * Reads a capability's route straight from the registry, for hosts that own {@code orazaka_db}.
 *
 * <p>The authoritative implementation of {@link CapabilityRoutingClient}: it reads the rows, and
 * every other implementation is a cache in front of an HTTP hop to a host running this one. That
 * asymmetry is deliberate — the routing table has exactly one owner (AGENTS.md §4/§5), and a
 * producer in another bounded context asks rather than keeping a second copy.
 *
 * <p><b>A disabled capability has no route.</b> Returning its row with {@code enabled=false} and
 * leaving the caller to check would make "did anyone remember to look?" the property that decides
 * whether a disabled capability still gets dispatched. Empty is the only answer that cannot be
 * ignored by accident.
