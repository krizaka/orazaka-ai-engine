 * when the turn's actor holds one of its roles, and a call the model makes is returned to the
 * client only when its tool was offered and the actor still holds the role. Both run on <b>every
 * turn</b>, from the actor the host declared and the roles as they are now; every refusal is
 * audited (the actor, the tool and the reason, never the arguments, ADR-064).
 *
 * <p>The roles of a client tool are data like the others: the administrator's row when there is
 * one, else administrators only ({@link ToolRegistry#LEAST_PRIVILEGE}). A tool the client invents
 * is therefore never offered to anybody who was not granted it.
