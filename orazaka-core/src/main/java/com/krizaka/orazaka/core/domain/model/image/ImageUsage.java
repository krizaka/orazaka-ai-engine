/**
 * What one image generation actually consumed.
 *
 * <p>The image twin of {@link com.krizaka.orazaka.core.domain.model.chat.TokenUsage}, and for the
 * same reason (ERR-127): this is the number image generation is billed on — {@code IMAGE_STEP},
 * which {@code ConsumptionReport} derives as {@code images × steps × megapixels} — and a value that
 * decides what a user is charged must not be reachable only by string key.
 *
 * <p>{@link #reported()} is the distinction {@code TokenUsage} draws, kept here: a generation whose
 * parameters are unknown is <b>unmeasured</b>, which releases the hold, and is a different fact
 * from one that consumed nothing.
 *
 * <p><b>Where each number comes from.</b> {@code images}, {@code width} and {@code height} are
 * measured on the image the provider returned. {@code steps} is the count the adapter sent with the
 * request — the caller's, else the catalogued model's, else the deployment's — so it is a fact
 * about what the server was asked to run. It used to be read from {@code IMAGE_GEN_STEPS}, the
 * variable the CLI also passed to {@code sd-server --steps}: one env var, two readers, and a bill
 * that was wrong the day they diverged (ADR-047). Sending the count closes that coupling.
 *
 * @param images images produced by the request
 * @param steps denoising steps per image
 * @param width output width in pixels
 * @param height output height in pixels
