/**
 * How an image is to be made, beyond what it shows: what to keep out of it, which seed to start
 * from, and how many denoising steps to spend.
 *
 * <p>Every field is optional, and absence means "the model's own recipe": the catalogue states a
 * model's step count ({@code orazaka_models.max_steps}) and the server it runs on states its
 * guidance and sampler at launch. A caller that names a seed gets the same image back for the same
 * prompt, size and model — which is what makes a published image reproducible, not a claim.
 *
 * <p>Self-validating (ERR-106): a value that no backend could honour is refused here, at the
 * boundary, rather than sent and silently clamped.
 *
 * @param negativePrompt what to keep out of the image; {@code null} or blank when nothing is.
 *     Honoured by models that sample with classifier-free guidance; a distilled model running at
 *     guidance 1 ignores it, and says so in its catalogue description
 * @param seed the noise seed, {@code null} for a fresh one; never negative
 * @param steps denoising steps, {@code null} for the model's own count; between 1 and {@value
 *     #MAX_STEPS}
