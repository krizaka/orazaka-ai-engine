/**
 * Stops a turn that carries crisis content and answers it with the pack's fixed, reviewed text.
 *
 * <p>Three properties, and each was learned somewhere else in this system before it was needed
 * here.
 *
 * <p><b>First in the chain.</b> Ahead of {@code ScopeGuardInterceptor}, which is itself ahead of
 * everything that spends. Measured with the scope guard (ADR-051 §3): a refusal that runs first
 * costs nothing, because nothing has been enriched, routed, refined or written into a history yet.
 * The order between the two guards is not cosmetic either — a message that says both <i>"je veux
 * mourir"</i> and <i>"quel médicament"</i> must get the crisis response, not the scope refusal.
 * Whichever runs first decides which answer a person in crisis reads.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code isAiDependent() == false}.</b> {@code orazaka.security.disable-ai=true} fails every
 * AI-dependent interceptor. A safety control that failed with them would be absent exactly when the
 * platform is running degraded, which is when it is most likely to be needed. This one reads a
 * declaration and a string; it calls nothing.
 *
 * <p><b>The response is never generated.</b> It arrives whole, written by the pack author and
 * reviewed by a person, with the region's verified crisis line already appended. Asking a model to
 * compose a crisis reply produces something shaped like one — including a phone number it invented,
 * which a person in crisis will dial (ADR-055 §4).
 *
 * <p>Inert for a pack that declares nothing, which is every pack below {@code REGULATED}.
