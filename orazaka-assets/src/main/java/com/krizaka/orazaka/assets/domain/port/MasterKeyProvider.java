 * Everything above it — the writer, the reader, the migrator — knows only that a data key goes in
 * and an opaque blob comes out, and that the blob is addressed by a {@code keyId}. A file-backed
 * provider puts a nonce and a GCM tag inside the blob; a KMS provider puts whatever the KMS
 * returns. Neither is visible here, and no caller may parse a blob.
 *
 * <p>The master key never leaves an implementation. There is no {@code getMasterKey()} and there
 * will not be one: it is the single secret whose compromise is total, and a method returning it
 * would be called.
