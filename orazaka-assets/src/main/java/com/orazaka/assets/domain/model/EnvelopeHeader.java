/**
 * The header of an encrypted asset: everything a reader needs before it can ask for a key.
 *
 * <p><b>Envelope, not direct encryption.</b> Each file carries its own data key, wrapped under a
 * master key this format never sees. Rotating the master key therefore rewraps a key per file — or,
 * done properly, rewraps nothing at all: {@link #keyId} says which master key wrapped this one, so
 * a new active key applies to new files while every old file still opens. Encrypting the bytes
 * directly under the master key would make rotation a rewrite of every file in the store, which is
 * the first thing a compliance audit asks about and the last thing anyone wants to schedule.
 *
 * <p><b>{@link #wrapped} is opaque on purpose.</b> The format stores whatever the key provider
 * returned and never parses it. A local provider puts a nonce and a GCM tag in there; a KMS puts
 * its own ciphertext blob. Neither the writer nor the reader knows which, which is what lets the
 * local path be the same code path as the one that matters.
 *
 * <p><b>Block-addressable.</b> AES-GCM cannot be decrypted from an arbitrary offset — the tag
 * covers the whole message — so a single-message file would make an HTTP {@code Range} on a video
 * decrypt the entire file to serve one second of it. The payload is therefore a sequence of
 * independently sealed blocks of {@link #blockSize} plaintext bytes each, and a range decrypts
 * {@code ceil(length / blockSize)} of them. See {@code docs/ASSET_ENCRYPTION.md} for the layout
 * that {@code app/envelope.py} implements on the other side.
 *
 * @param version the format version; a reader refuses anything it does not know
 * @param blockSize plaintext bytes per sealed block
 * @param plainLength the plaintext length, which is also the {@code Content-Length} served
 * @param keyId which master key wrapped {@link #wrapped}
 * @param wrapped the wrapped data key, opaque to this format
 * @param noncePrefix eight random bytes per file; the block index supplies the other four
 * @param headerLength where the first block starts
