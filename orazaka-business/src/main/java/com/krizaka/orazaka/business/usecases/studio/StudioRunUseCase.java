/**
 * Runs an installed Studio as a first-class {@code Intention} (ADR-034 §9.2).
 *
 * <p>This is the point of having an {@code Intention} abstraction at all: a Studio run becomes
 * reachable from the intent controller, the CLI and the agent loop alike, rather than only from the
 * Studio service's own REST surface. Not routing it through here would have made the marketplace a
 * web-only feature.
 *
 * <p>The use-case is deliberately <b>thin</b>. {@code business} coordinates and hosts no engine
 * (AGENTS.md §2): the DAG interpreter lives in the studio service, reached through the Tier-1
 * {@link StudioRunClient} port whose HTTP adapter is supplied by {@code orazaka-studio-client}.
 * That indirection is what keeps this library free of a dependency on another context's Tier-3
 * implementation, which SEAM-002 forbids.
 *
 * <p>{@link PlanningMode#DETERMINISTIC}: the plan is the blueprint, decided by an admin at publish
 * time. Nothing here asks a model what to do next.
